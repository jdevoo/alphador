# Alpha Dor

Simple front-end for [Dell Doradus](https://github.com/dell-oss/Doradus). Started with Spider databases. Still work-in-progress.

## Installation

Deploy on a web server and access from a browser. Assumes running Cassandra and Doradus.

## Usage

Start clicking the connect button in the navbar to connect to your Doradus instance. The user interface is loosely based on an OO browser as those found in Smalltalk.
